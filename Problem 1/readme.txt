The Solution:
- This solution finds the first equilibrium index of a given list. If no equilibrium index is found, it returns -1

Running the solution:
- To run the solution, import solution.py then run 'solution.solution([array to find equilibrim index in])'

- A sample run.py program is included which runs the solution using the example array [-1, 3, -4, 5, 1, -6, 2, 1]
